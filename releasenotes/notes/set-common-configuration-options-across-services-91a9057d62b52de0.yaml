fixes:

    There are a couple of configuration options that need to be set not only
    for the worker but also for other Octavia services. For example, on a
    composable node deployment where the API runs on a separate node than
    the rest of the Octavia services, the network driver was not being set
    (hence defaulting to noop driver) while for the worker the driver was
    allowed_address_pairs_driver. Another example is the database that was only
    being set for the API service. Such configuration misalignment and
    omissions lead to operate Octavia services and its resources.
